\section{Introduction}

TODO Brief description of the Project

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{Approach}

TODO The approach that you used to implement TCP Connection Management Protocol

\subsection{Connection Established / Data Transmission State}

TODO How you implemented the retransmission mechanism in the Connection Established / Data Transmission State of the TCP

\subsection{Additional Mechanisms}

TODO Any additional mechanisms that you added

\section{Verification with Spin}

\subsection{Immediate and LTL Assertions}

TODO List of Immediate and LTL Assertions and Descriptions. For each assertion you incorporate, it must be accompanied by a description of what you are trying to verify. E.g., what behaviour of the TCP / retransmission mechanism you are trying to check the correctness?

\section{Mutation Testing}

TODO
For each mutant / fault:
∗ Label it as MUTANT\_XX (where XX is an integer)
∗ Describe the intented incorrect behaviour that your TCP protocol should generate, and indicate the location (in terms of line number) of the mutant 6
∗ Which assertion should catch the incorrect behaviour? Indicate the assertion based on the label number (E.g., “...MUTANT\_05 was caught by assertion LTL\_47...”
∗ Did the assertion (immediate or LTL) was able to detect the incorrect behaviour? If not, can you suggest another immediate or LTL assertion to add?

\section{Conclusions}

TODO Closing remarks on the implementation of your Promela model and the approach you taken to verify the TCP protocol
