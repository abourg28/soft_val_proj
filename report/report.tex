\section{Introduction}

Our project abides by the protocols mentioned in the project specifications to implement a model of TCP. To mirror the Finite State Machine we have named our \textit{proctypes} as client and server. The communication between these \textit{proctypes} is done with the use of two channels. States are represented as labels in the promela code. The data transmission state was simply modelled with a packet containing one byte which has a value of either 0 or 1.

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{Approach}

Here are a few the things that need to be modelled:
\begin{itemize}
\item Server and client start off as \verb|CLOSED|.
\item Server can enter \verb|LISTEN| before/after the client sends \verb|SYN|.
\item Server's \verb|SYN| is corrupted. Client needs to reset.
\item Once the connection is established both client and server can send data to the other.
\item With an established connection both client and server can close the connection.
\item Client and server can both send a \verb|FIN| at the same time.
\end{itemize}

We decided to have server and client as separate \textit{proctypes}. Signals
are sent between these \textit{proctypes} through two channels:
\verb|toServer| and \verb|toClient|.

\subsection{Connection Established / Data Transmission State}

Once the connection is established both \textit{proctypes} enter a \verb|do|
loop. Inside the loop each \textit{proctype} listens for a signal from the
other. In order to avoid deadlock, the client sends a signal first. This is an
arbitrary decision. However, having the client always send the first signal
does not correctly model the behaviour of TCP. This was addressed by having
additional signals. More specifically: \verb|TIMEOUT| and \verb|IDLE|. This
way the client will non-deterministically send either a \verb|SEND| where the
data is either a 0 or 1, a \verb|FIN| to close the connection, or an
\verb|IDLE| to simulate doing nothing.

When a \textit{proctype} signals a \verb|SEND| the other \textit{proctype}
will non-deterministically chose between whether to send an \verb|ACK| or to
simulate a lost packet. In TCP, upon a lost packet the sender will retransmit
a packet once the timeout is reached. To simulate this behaviour, the
\textit{proctype} receiving the data will send a \verb|TIMEOUT| signal to
the sender. The sender will then retransmit the same data until it receives
an \verb|ACK|.

\section{Verification with Spin}

\subsection{Immediate and LTL Assertions}

Immediate assertions were added in multiple places to assert that there are no unwanted signals. Here is the list of immediate assertions:
\\

IMM\_1:\\
Description:\\
This assertion makes sure that when a \textit{proctype} has sent data it should receive either an \verb|ACK| or \verb|TIMEOUT| signal from the other.
\\

IMM\_2:\\
Description:\\
This assertion makes sure that when a \textit{proctype} is in the data transmission state, it only receives the following signals from the other: \verb|SEND|, \verb|FIN|, and \verb|IDLE|.
\\

IMM\_3:\\
Description:\\
This assertion makes sure that when a \textit{proctype} is in the data transmission state, it does not break out of the \verb|do| loop.
\\

IMM\_4:\\
Description:\\
This assertion makes sure that when a \textit{proctype} is in the \verb|FIN WAIT 1| state it should only receive a \verb|FIN| or \verb|ACK| signal from the other.
\\

LTL assertions were created for ensuring the behaviour as depicted in the given Finite State Machine. The never claim of each LTL assertion was copied into the TCP model and ran to ensure that the model is functioning as expected. Here is the list of LTL assertions:

\section{Conclusions}

Promela is a language that is hard to code nicely. For projects like this it
is very easy to get lost. I made use of labels to try to organize my code
however that can only do so much. Had this not been the case I would have
gladly made this model more general and more comprehensive. For example it
would be nice to model several clients connecting to a server. In addition
coming up with all these LTL assertions are long and mind-numbing. Having said
that the project was interesting.
